# 🌌 SpaceScope AI – Ask the Universe

**SpaceScope AI** is a full-stack, AI-powered space knowledge assistant that allows users to ask natural language questions about astronomy, celestial events, and space science — and get accurate, moderated answers generated by large language models.

The app is built with modern, production-grade tools and designed for real-world usability, education, and exploration. Developed in 1 week for the **Stellar Gateway Hackathon**, it’s now fully deployed and publicly accessible.

## 🚀 What It Does

🔭 **SpaceScope AI** enables users to:

- Ask questions about space, missions, planets, and more  
- Get safe, factual, and concise answers powered by Groq-hosted LLMs  
- Built-in **content moderation** filters harmful or inappropriate queries using an LLM-based structured evaluation
- Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with data from NASA, arxiv and more sources for deeper insights
- Clean, responsive frontend deployed on Vercel

## 💡 Why I Built It

Space is fascinating — but learning about it can feel overwhelming or inaccessible, especially for students or underserved communities.  

**SpaceScope AI** makes the cosmos more understandable, safe, and interactive through natural language.

This project was built within one week for the **Stellar Gateway Hackathon 🚀**.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- 🧑‍🚀 **Students & Educators** – Explore the universe with natural language questions
- 🛰️ **Amateur Astronomers** – Get fast answers backed by trusted sources
- 🧠 **Curious Minds** – Learn something new about space every day

## 🧠 AI Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct Q&A (Normal Mode) | Sends the user’s query directly to a hosted LLM via Groq (LLaMA3.3) |
| RAG Mode               | Retrieves relevant document chunks from ChromaDB and uses them as context   |
| Moderation             | Evaluates every query using a dedicated LLM(LLaMA3.1) to ensure safe content   |
| Source Attribution     | Metadata (title + URL) from retrieved documents is returned separately in RAG responses |

## 🎉 How I Built It

- Spent ~40 hours across backend, frontend, deployment, and debugging
- Learned to deploy ChromaDB with GCS persistence
- Used Groq for fast, reliable LLM inference
- Utilized Langsmith for monitoring
- Vercel + Tailwind for frontend speed and aesthetics

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### 🧩 Backend (API) – Deployed on Google Cloud Run

- **FastAPI** for serving `/ask`, `/collections` endpoints
- **Groq API** for lightning-fast LLM responses
- **Pydantic** for strict schema validation
- **ChromaDB** for vector-based document retrieval (RAG)
- **GCS Bucket** for persistent vector storage via Cloud Run volumes

### 🎨 Frontend – Deployed on Vercel

- **React** + **TailwindCSS** for a clean, modern, responsive UI
- Two-mode toggle: Normal / RAG
- Source listing in UI

## 🧪 Example Queries

Try these questions:

- “How does a star born?”
- “How many moons does Jupiter have?”
- “When is the next lunar eclipse?”
- “What was the last mission to Mars?”

## 📚 Data Sources (RAG)

- NASA Open Data APIs
- ArXiv: Astronomy & Astrophysics papers (planned)
- Curated Wikipedia astronomy articles (planned)
- ISS event logs and space mission timelines (planned)
- Other web sources

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- RAG answers depend on available documents in the ChromaDB instance
- Moderation may over-filter edge cases or sensitive scientific topics
- Some astronomy queries may require up-to-date external data (e.g., live ISS data not yet integrated)

## 🌠 What’s Next (Post-Hackathon Goals)

- In-app history and saved questions
- User-authenticated dashboards
- Integration of more sources for RAG
- Real-time space event API integration (NASA APIs)
